# Welcome

Hello! Welcome to my homelab docs site!
This is my first blog site (hooray)
This first page is mainly for unstructions on how to write a blog post so I remember later. For the main header - use a single hashtag and a space to signal the header 1 font, i.e. '# Welcome' above

## Title 2

use a double hashtag and a space to signal the header 2 font.

### Title 3

use a triple hashtag and a space to signal the header 3 font. You get the idea. 

* unordered bullet
* points
* are written with stars 

## Code Blocks

Use ``` and ``` as bounds, for first ```do ``` javascript or ```c to idenitfy the language, examples below: 

```javascript
console.log('hello world!);
```

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
