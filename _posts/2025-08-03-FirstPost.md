# Welcome

Hello! This blog will be documenting my Georgia Tech OMSCS journey, personal, and professional projects. I find that writing through my projects helps me retain my knowledge, esp with coding. All of my OMSCS code is in my private github repo. The rest of this post is for quick tips on blog posts and useful links for making blog posts using jekyll chrip theme, mainly for me, not really for review.  

## Title 2

use a double hashtag and a space to signal the header 2 font.

### Title 3

use a triple hashtag and a space to signal the header 3 font. You get the idea. 

* unordered bullet
* points
* are written with stars 

## Code Blocks

Use ``` and ``` as bounds, for first ```do ``` javascript or ```c to idenitfy the language, examples below: 

```javascript
console.log('hello world!);
```

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
