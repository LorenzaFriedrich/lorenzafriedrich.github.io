# Welcome
#### Note
For all OMSCS courses - I will provide pseudocode and video links, but I need to keep code in a private repository to uphold the honor code. Descriptions, notes, etc are below. 

# Projects

## Setting up my test environment 
The first thing you do in GIOS is set up your test environment. There are a million different ways to do this, I settled on VS code and docker following the tutorial below: 
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-TLnnWRfcqFjuzlaAvsxXppVnlklKBb9FBv_stK86tg/edit?tab=t.0

I also ended up setting up vagrant instance and a virtual box ubuntu in a moment of panic and I'll walk through as well. 

### VSCode and Docker 
#### Georgia Tech Resources
GIOS repo: 
- https://github.gatech.edu/gios-fall-25/environment

#### Step 1
- Install Linux on Windows with WSL (for GIOSFA25 get UBUNTU 20.04)
- Install Docker Desktop and add GIOS image
- Resource: https://www.docker.com/ && 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
```powershell
wsl.exe --install Ubuntu-20.04
```
Notes:
- Make sure you set your linux default WSL to the 20.04 ubuntu for GIOS (see Microsoft documentation)
- Make sure you are on WSL 2 not 1 to avoid errors

#### Step 2
- Open WSL and get vscode on wsl
```bash
wsl
code .
```
Notes:
- in VSCode get the Docker, Remote Development, and C/C++ extensions

#### Step 3
- Download all the absolutely necessary code provided in the GIOS repo in vscode (since it should have opened after it downloaded) or linux terminal 
Including: Add the course PPA, update the repos, install requirements (gcc should work after you've done this)

#### Step 4
- Add the tutorial's configure.yml file to a home folder you plan on using for the projects 
```yaml
name: cs6200-gios            # see Ref 1 below
services:
  cs6200-gios:               # see Ref 1 below
    image: gtomscs6200/fall25-environment:latest # note: set appropriately to current semester
    container_name: dev-env  # see Ref 1 below
    tty: true                # see Ref 2 below
    working_dir: /home/files
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - .:/home/files:rw     # see Ref 3 below


# Ref 1: These names/labels can be set according to your preference

# Ref 2: https://stackoverflow.com/a/42597165

# Ref 3: general form is `<host-path>:<container-path>:rw`, where `.` here denotes the host-system 
# location in which `docker compose up -d` command is run on file `compose.yaml`, with
# corresponding bind mounting to container location `/home/files` as designated above. Note that you
# may designate `<container-path>` per your own preference. Suffix `:rw` denotes read & write modes.
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/ and
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes for more details.


```
#### Step 5
- Open the container extension in VSCode and you should see:
![Desktop View](/img/img1.PNG){: width="972" height="589" }
_Full screen width and center alignment_

#### Unit Tests
git clone https://github.com/nemequ/munit.git
gcc -Wall example.c munit.c munit.h -o example
./example
