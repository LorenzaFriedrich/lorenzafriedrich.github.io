# Welcome to my Portfolio! 

### Projects

#### Unity Videogame - GoreDash

3D Third-Person Delivery Game (Unity)
![alt text](../assets/img/GoreDash/pickup.gif)
Developed with a four-person team, this project challenges players to complete timed deliveries across a city while avoiding enemy rats and robbers. Players follow a dynamic waypoint system, manage health and time, and use collectibles to survive.

Core Features: Pickup & delivery system, level progression, dynamic waypoint arrow, HUD with health/timer/objectives, start/pause menus, options (volume, restart, game over), and loading screens.

Collectibles: Health packs (restore health), speed boosts (temporary movement increase), pepper spray (stuns rats for 10 seconds).

Enemies: Rats: AI-controlled with chase, patrol, and idle states; damage on contact; can be stunned. Robbers: Target the delivery box; chase when carried; steal package on contact and reset it to start; also damage the player.

Player Abilities: Running, picking up/delivering packages, using collectibles for survival and strategy.

### Skills

#### Note
Due to Georgia Institute of Technology's strict policies around sharing code and my previous job's policies around sharing proprietary work, I can't share github repositories easily, nor a majority of my accomplishments. This page is my best attempt to showcase my skills in a way that is easily accessible for recruiters/interested parties. Feel free to scroll through the rest of the posts on this site if you are interested.
