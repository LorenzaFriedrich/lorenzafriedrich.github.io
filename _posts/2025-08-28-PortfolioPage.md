# Welcome to my Portfolio! 

### Projects

#### Unity Videogame - GoreDash

#### PSI Lisp Interpreter in C

#### Unreal Engine - Rube Goldberg Machine

#### Frogget - Arduino Pixel Chix Project (In Progress)

### Skills

#### Note
Due to Georgia Institute of Technology's strict policies around sharing code and my previous job's policies around sharing proprietary work, I can't share github repositories easily, nor a majority of my accomplishments. This page is my best attempt to showcase my skills in a way that is easily accessible for recruiters/interested parties. Feel free to scroll through the rest of the posts on this site if you are interested.
