# Welcome
#### Note
For all OMSCS courses - I will provide pseudocode and video links, but I need to keep code in a private repository to uphold the honor code, descriptions, notes, etc are below.

## Group Project: GoreDash

## Individual Assignments 

### Milestone 0 - Roll a Ball Unity Tutorial 
- https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball

### Milestone 1 - Character Animation

In an exisiting unity scene - implement the following: 
1. A character without root motion that turns programmatically without root motion.  
2. A character with root motion that… 
- a. Can have variable walking and running speeds and animations in all directions.   
- b. Has publicly modifiable scalars for these root motion parameters.  
- c. Will be able to move to a target location and point to the target after a button press. 
3. A Minion (yes from the movie) character with root motion that hops and twists while moving. This minion will 
also have squeaky footsteps. 

### Milestone 2 – Physics Simulation 

- Vertical stack of three (3) blue rigidbody spheres with collision sounds 
- Vertical stack of three (3) red rigidbody spheres that don’t collide with one another. 
- Asset Store model “Free Japanese Mask” with custom compound collider that tips over on nose 
- yellow jointed chain made of at least five (5) rigidbody GameObjects 
- blue kinematic rigidbody elevator using Mecanim animation with red rigidbody sphere going for a ride 
- green Weeble Wobble/Punching Bozo that tilts but can’t be knocked over 
- a purple cube with rigidbody box that does not slide down the ramp 
- green cube with rigidbody box that does slide down the ramp 
- orange rigidbody sphere that bounces 
- Y_Bot ragdoll that collapses over the hurdle GameObject  
- black click beetle or jumping bean that jumps intermittently and is autonomous 
- Make a pause script that starts the game paused and unpauses with “p” keypress

### Milestone 3 – Game Menus and Collectables 
- Working Game Start Menu with dedicated scene 
- Working In-Game Menu in original gameplay scene 
- Collectable ball that only SomeDude_RootMotion can collect 
- Trigger-based animated prefab object placed in three (3) locations in scene 
### Milestone 4 – Artificial Intelligence 
- AI controlled Minion visits 5 stationary waypoints 
- AI controlled Minion heads off moving waypoint (that is visible) and has a visualization of minion’s predicted position (visible destination tracker object)
- AI is controlled by procedural state machine of at least 2 states where the minion visits 5 stationary waypoints, then heads off moving waypoint, then goes back to visiting 5 stationary waypoints, then heads off moving waypoint,….going on forever in that pattern.
- Minion is animated with steps and not sunk into ground
