Course completed Summer 2025
#### Note
For all OMSCS courses - I will provide pseudocode and video links, but I need to keep code in a private repository to uphold the honor code, descriptions, notes, etc are below.

## Individual Assignments 

### Milestone 0 - Roll a Ball Unity Tutorial 
- https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball

### Milestone 1 - Character Animation

This milestone focused on implementing diverse character animation systems in Unity. A non-root motion character was programmed to turn without animation-based movement, while a root motion character was built to handle variable walking and running speeds in all directions, with publicly adjustable parameters for fine-tuning. The root motion character could also move toward and face a target after a button press. Additionally, a Minion character was animated with root motion to hop and twist while moving, complete with squeaky footstep sounds for added effect.
also have squeaky footsteps. 

### Milestone 2 – Physics Simulation 

The second milestone showcased Unity’s physics engine through interactive simulations. A variety of rigidbody setups were created: blue spheres stacked with collision sounds, red spheres that didn’t collide with each other, a Japanese mask with a compound collider that tips over, and a yellow chain with jointed rigidbodies. Other implementations included a kinematic elevator carrying a sphere, a wobbling Weeble Wobble that never falls over, friction and sliding tests with cubes on ramps, a bouncy orange sphere, and a Y_Bot ragdoll collapsing over a hurdle. Autonomous motion was demonstrated with a click beetle that jumps intermittently. A custom pause script was also added, starting the game paused and resuming on a keypress.

### Milestone 3 – Game Menus and Collectables 
This milestone introduced UI systems and collectible mechanics. A dedicated start menu scene was implemented to launch gameplay, alongside an in-game pause menu within the main scene. Collectables were integrated with restrictions—only the SomeDude_RootMotion character could pick up a special ball. Additionally, an animated prefab was set up to trigger events when approached, and three instances of it were placed throughout the scene to encourage exploration.
### Milestone 4 – Artificial Intelligence 
The final milestone implemented AI-driven behavior using procedural state machines. A Minion character was animated to walk naturally and interact with the environment without clipping into the ground. The AI was programmed to patrol five stationary waypoints, then pursue a moving waypoint while displaying a predicted position via a visible tracker. This cycle repeated indefinitely, demonstrating a dynamic two-state AI system that alternates between waypoint patrol and moving target pursuit.
