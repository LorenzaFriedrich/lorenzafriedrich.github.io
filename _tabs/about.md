## Hello!

Thanks for checking out my blog :) Right now - I am in a career transition from chemical engineering into computer science, using Georgia Institute of Technology Master's in Computer Science program (OMSCS) as my pathway there. I am a full time student, interested in internships/entry level work to move into software/technology. I have a personal interest in graphics programming, GPU optimization, video games, and art, most of my personal projects will reflect that. Any code generated outside of OMSCS is something I'll share - if it's internal to OMSCS, I'm keeping in a private GitHub Repository, and I would need to check before sharing.
